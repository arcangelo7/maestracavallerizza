	  Over the years, the range of the services I offer has widened as more and more exposure over the years led to more and more possibilities to integrate my abilities to offer a holistic service-set. The services I offer today enable my clients to seamlessly integrate one vision into technology, design, and language for enhanced business benefit.<br /> 
My core services can be classified under the following heads:<br /> <br /> 
<b>Business Consulting</b><br /> 
At the end of the day, it is an accepted fact that profitability is all about your business model and the overall efficiency of your setup. I have been fortunate to have worked with numerous organizations helping them fine-tune their business strategy and streamline their internal operations, leading to better services and products, leading, in turn, to enhanced customer satisfaction and overall profitability. <br /> 
As a business consultant, I offer the following services geared to help you get the best out of your setup:<br /> 
<ul>
<li>Business Strategy</li>
<li>Operational Consulting</li>
<li>Product / Service Sales Lifecycle</li></ul>
<b>Business Strategy</b><br /> 
An effective high-level business strategy has typically been seen to be the secret behind the success of most companies that have done well. Typically, every company has an avowed long-term vision, which is organized into smaller time-bound missions. Your business strategy is your company&acute;s chosen path towards these missions, and are critical for their success. <br /> 
Working closely with your core management, I study, capture, and present your existing business strategy. <br /> 
Post strategy capture, I engage your management team in sessions dedicated to strategy and strategy implementation analysis. Typically, these sessions help you identify the gaps (if any) within your business strategy, and help your team arrive at a better understanding of the manner in which your core strategy has translated into processes and procedures on the work floor. <br /> 
By the time existing core strategies, processes, and procedures are captured, your core management will be ready to engage in discussions leading to a reevaluation and enhancement of your business strategies. This will, in turn cascade as evolved processes and procedures within your organization. The net result of this exercise will be enhanced integration across the various teams within your organization and a greater clarity in terms of where your organization needs to go and what it needs to do to get there.<br /> 
With enhanced processes and procedures captured and documented, your team will be in a position to chalk out steady plans for training and materials creation for identified departments within your organization. <br /> 
As newer and newer needs emerge, your organization will be ready to evolve to the next level of operational efficiency and will be ready to handle emerging requirements very much by itself.<br /> <br /> 
<b>Technology Consulting</b><br /> 
Apart from streamlined processes and procedures, operationalizing a business vision also requires measured investment in technology in terms of both off-the-shelf and custom-built applications. Over the past years, I have worked with numerous companies, helping them identify their technology-related requirements, offering guidance towards choosing the right product to suit their current and future requirements, and in creating and customizing applications to suit their specific technological needs. <br /> 
I offer the following technology-related services:<br /> 
<ul>
<li>Software Planning and Procurement</li>
<li>Software Deployment and Upgrade Management</li>
<li>Application Customization / Enhancement Services </li></ul>
If you wish to know more about any of these services, please do get in touch with me.<br /> 
Product / Service Sales Lifecycle<br /> 
I have worked with a variety of technology-driven organizations, helping them plan and implement sales lifecycles for their products / services. For obvious reasons, the lifecycles associated with selling a product and a service are rather different, and a range of factors need to be taken into account to recommend an effective sales strategy for different stages of a product or service for a client. <br /> 
I offer the following services under the head of Product / Service Sales Lifecycle:<br /> 
<ul>
<li>Product Sales Lifecycle Product Positioning </li>
<li>Product Sales Lifecycle Strategization</li>
<li>Product Sales Training Delivery</li>
<li>Service Sales Lifecycle </li>
<li>Service Differentiation</li>
<li>Service Sales Lifecycle Strategization</li>
<li>Service Sales Training Delivery</li>
</ul>
For more details on any of these services, please contact me.<br /> <br /> 

<b>Technology Consulting</b><br /> 
Technology has been this generation&acute;s greatest enabler, the greatest source of change, globalization, and expanding bottomlines. As a consulting professional who has grown and flourished among the technological advances that have marked our generation, I have evolved a set of specific services designed to offer businesses like yours the greatest business leverage at minimal costs:<br /> 
<ul><li>Software Development</li>
<li>Application Management</li>
<li>Project Management</li></ul>
<b>Software Development</b><br /> 
If off-the-shelf doesn&acute;t necessarily work for you, and you are looking for a service provider who can understand your specific needs nd create software that can help you quickly achieve your business goals, I can help you. With expertise and experience across development platforms and technologies, I can help you reach out to your market or optimize your internal operations through requirements-based blueprint-driven software solutions. Coupled with my ability to offer web design and UI design services, I can function as your single point of contact for all your software development and deployment needs. <br /> 
For more information on how I can help you save time and money through strategic application development, please contact me.<br /> <br />
<b>Application Management</b><br /> 
With time and evolving technology and business requirements, your in-house software could quicly turn into a liability unless it is properly managed and updated. As a technology professional with a proven track record in application management and feature enhancement, I can ensure that your software keeps pace with your evolving requirements. Under the Application Management umbrella, I also offer a variety of services such as off-the-shelf-product upgrades, application maintenance, and remote application monitoring.<br /> 
For more information on how I can help you simplify and optimize your off-the-shelf and customized application management, please contact me.<br /><br /> 
<b>Project Management</b><br /> 
For reasons of both security and urgency, organizations are often wary of offloading complete application development or management tasks offsite. For such companies, having an experienced and dependable source of management consulting can be optimal. Your software stays on your premises and is handled either by your own people or consultants who work onsite, and the project and team is managed by a capable and experienced manager. Leveraging a combination of onsite and remote monitoring and systematized planning, i can help you reduce your application development / management costs by offering dependable project management services. With an experience of executing a number of projects for clients of various sizes and requirements, I have the ability to simplify your software needs without your incurring unnecessary expenditure on these counts.<br /> 
Please do get in touch with me to explore project management options that work for your organization.<br /> <br /> 

<b>Communication Consulting</b><br /> 
In a world where image is everything, the quality of your literature can seriously impact your positioning, your visibility, and your success as an business entity. I offer a range of communication consulting services that are designed to help you take your organization to the leadership levels it deserves. <br /> 
My Communication Consulting services comprise the following major heads:<br /> 
<ul>
<li>Marketing Communication</li>
<li>Technical Communication</li></ul>
Marketing Communication<br /> 
From product positioning and branding to SEO, web site content and brochures case studies and whitepapers that enable you to position and present your business on the global stage, I can offer you the entire range of marketing services your business needs. Marketing, like the other aspects of business, depends heavily on the overall vision and business strategy that drives your organization. I can help you transform your business strategy into key points that can then be leveraged onto your core businesses, offering a cogent vision of what your company, your product, and your brand stands for.<br /> 
Under the Marketing Communications umbrella, I offer the following services:<br /> 
<ul><li>Product Positioning &amp;  Competition Analysis</li>
<li>SEO-driven Web Content Creation</li>
<li>Brochure &amp;  Case Studies</li>
<li>Whitepapers</li></ul>
Technical Communication<br /> 
Technical Communication is a term that is rather losely used, and refers almost slightingly to a range of documents that describe various aspects of the software / appliance that you sell. As a matter of fact, technical documentation is as much a need-to-have for your business as the software / appliance itself. As a person with experience in both business and technology, I understand. Usable design notwithstanding, customers simply hate buying into technology until they are offered an accompanying document explaining how to get the best out of their purchase.<br /> 
I offer the following Technical Communication Services:<br /> 
<ul>
<li>Application / Appliance Help Files</li>
<li>Application / Appliance User Manuals</li>
<li>QuickStart &amp;  Admin Guides</li>
<li>Product Demos</li></ul>
For detailed information about any of these services, please contact me.<br /> <br /> 
<b>Design Consulting</b><br /> 
Communication today is no longer just a verbal affair; streamlined design and animation are as much a necessity today as quality content. No wonder companies across the world are investing millions on an annual basis, creating better design, animation, and overall user experience in order to better identify themselves and their services to their clients.<br /> 
As a designer experienced in the usage of design and multimedia for business, I can help you build an identity, a brand, that endures, and ensble you to position your business as one of the front-runners in your chosen area of excellence.<br /> 
I offer the following design services:<br /> 
<ul><li>Web Design &amp;  Branding</li>
<li>UI Design</li></ul>
Web Design &amp;  Branding<br /> 
Starting off with helping you create an identity for your company and products / services, I can help you leverage your new identity to create a consistent set of materials to offer the user a unique design experience that is truly world class. Based out of your high-level corporate vision and time-bound business strategy, I ensure that your logo and design elements are in sync with the rest of your business, offering a powerful combined message to all existing and prospective clients.<br /> 
With a well-designed web site functioning as your online front-end, you can rest assured that users coming into your site are impressed with your offerings, significantly raising your chances of having converted another prospect. As part of the branding exercise, I can also help you create flash advertisements that can be either posted on your sites, or on your partners, leading to greater exposure for your organization and business.<br /> <br />

<li>Flash Animation for Adverts / Visiting Cards</li>
</ul>
UI Design<br /> 
They say a well-designed application never needs a help file. I can help you get there! Your investment in technology and functionality notwithstanding, one of the first -- and most enduring -- things that your client will experience is the actual look &amp;  feel of your application. If your UI fails to impress in terms of sheer usability and look &amp;  feel, the client can find working with the software more and more cumbersome, and may even consider stopping using it altogether. Does the interface look inviting? Is the functionality of the application reflected in the way the focus of the cursor moves across the fields in the screen? Is the button selected by default on your screen &acute;OK&acute; or &acute;Cancel&acute;? These and numerous other questions can actually determine the long-term durability of your application in the market. <br /> 
I can help you create UI for your software such that customer delight is guaranteed. With continued usage and growing comfort over time, a well-designed user interface can actually help you retain clients as effectively as the best functionality or product support you may offer.<br /> 
For more information about my Design Consulting services, please contact me.<br /> <br /> 
<b>Process Consulting</b><br /> 
Different organizations operate differently, and one of the main reasons for this is that their goals are different, as is their overall business strategy. My Proess Consulting service offering aims to help you translate your business vision and strategy into viable policies, operational processes, and on-the-floor procedures. With every aspect of your operations optimally architected, designed, documented and monitored, you can rest assured that the overall on-the-floor efficiency within your organization shall see a significant improvement. <br /> 
With continual process improvement initiatives like training and KPI reformulations, you save more and more in terms of both time and money while evolving into a more stable, more integrated organization. Integrated operations, in turn, leads to better service delivery, leading to greater customer satisfaction and enhanced profitability.<br /> 
I combine state-of-the-art tools, techniques and operational metrics to offer you rapid process-driven efficiency at minimal rates, helping you quickly achieve ROI and scale your organizational capabilities to deliver more services -- better services -- using the same teams.<br />
